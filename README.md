## Hello, I'm Shannon ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I recently graduated with a master's in Biostatistics from National Taiwan University.

### Projects
1. [Masterâ€™s Thesis: A Testing Procedure for Identifying Dispersion Effects](https://github.com/shansshe/project-files/blob/main/2023%20OofA%20slide.pdf): In this study, a new testing method using fiducial generalized pivotal quantities is developed to identify active dispersion effects in unreplicated order-of-addition experiments. Simulations show that this approach effectively controls empirical Type I error rates, with a drug combination experiment illustrating its application.

3. [Sampling and Clustering Analysis of Soybean Germplasm](https://github.com/shansshe/project-files/blob/main/2019%20CC%20poster.jpg)
4. [FunCore: a Core Gene Database for Fungi](https://github.com/shansshe/project-files/blob/main/2018%20FunCore%20poster.pdf)

### Side Projects
1. [Uncovering the Impact of
Climate on Indego Bike Rentals](https://github.com/shansshe/project-files/blob/main/Indego%20slide.pdf): Weather-related variables accounted for 79.14% of the variability in bike rental data. Findings indicate an increase in daily rentals during the fall season, with warmer weather conditions further contributing to higher rental rates.
2. [Second-hand Bookstore DB Design](https://github.com/shansshe/SecondHand-Bookstore-DB): This project designs a MySQL database for a second-hand bookstore, featuring an ER model that visualizes the relationships between customers, staff, and publications. The database consists of nine tables that include information about customers, publications, staff, and providers, allowing for efficient data management and comprehensive analysis of bookstore operations.

2. [Stock Crawler and Data Visualization](https://github.com/shansshe/stock-crawler): Retrieve historical stock price data from TWSE and visualize it using a line chart.
